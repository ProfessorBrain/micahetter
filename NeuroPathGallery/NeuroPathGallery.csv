Parkinson disease,parkinson1.png,A middle-aged woman presents with frequent falls.,Here we see neurons containing eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Lewy bodies) composed of misfolded alpha-synuclein.,STEP1
CJD,cjd.png,A man presents with rapidly progressive memory loss and behavioral changes.,"Here we see spongiform change of the cerebral cortex with numerous small intracellular and extracellular vacuoles in the gray matter, marked neuronal loss, and reactive astrocytosis, without significant inflammatory infiltrate.",
Glioblastoma,gbm1.png,"A 62-year-old man presents with progressive headaches, new-onset focal weakness, and MRI showing an irregular ring-enhancing mass that crosses the corpus callosum.","Here we see marked nuclear pleomorphism, frequent mitotic figures, prominent microvascular proliferation, and regions of pseudopalisading necrosis.",STEP1
Glioblastoma,gbm2.png,"A 58-year-old woman presents with several weeks of worsening morning headaches, new-onset seizures, and MRI revealing a heterogenous ring-enhancing frontal lobe mass with surrounding vasogenic edema.","Here we see marked nuclear pleomorphism, frequent mitotic figures, prominent microvascular proliferation, and regions of pseudopalisading necrosis.",STEP1
Pilocytic astrocytoma,pilocytic.png,"A child presents with headaches, vomiting, and gait instability. MRI reveals a well-circumscribed cystic cerebellar lesion with an enhancing mural nodule.",Here we see elongated “hairlike” (pilocytic) astrocytes with Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies.,STEP1
Pilocytic astrocytoma,pilocytic1.png,"A 10-year-old child presents with progressive blurry vision. MRI shows a well-circumscribed, contrast-enhancing mass involving the cerebellum with cystic components.",Here we see elongated “hairlike” (pilocytic) astrocytes with Rosenthal fibers and eosinophilic granular bodies.,STEP1
Metastatic adenocarcinoma,adenocarcinoma.png,"A 65-year-old man with a 40-pack-year smoking history presents with new-onset seizures and progressive headache. He has had several months of cough, weight loss, and fatigue. MRI of the brain shows multiple ring-enhancing lesions at the gray-white junction with surrounding vasogenic edema.","Here we see malignant gland-forming epithelial cells arranged in irregular acinar and tubular structures, with pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and frequent mitoses.",
Meningioma,meningioma1.png,A person presents with seizures and an extra-axial mass.,Here we see epithelioid cells forming whorled nests with interspersed concentrically laminated psammoma bodies.,STEP1
Crangiopharygioma,craniopharyngioma.png,"A 12-year-old child presents with headaches, growth delay, and difficulty seeing objects on either side while looking straight ahead. MRI of the brain reveals a partly cystic, calcified suprasellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and pituitary stalk.","Here we see stratified squamous epithelium with a palisading basal layer and loose stellate reticulum–like cells, along with cystic spaces filled with “wet” keratin, cholesterol clefts, and frequent calcifications.",STEP1
Crangiopharygioma,craniopharyngioma1.png,"A 15-year-old adolescent with delayed puberty presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and progressive difficulty seeing objects in his peripheral vision.
